================================================================

The original version at http://garbas.github.io/migrations-with-transmogrifier/index.html
is pretty nice but I am not able to maintain it - after eight years sphinx - latest 
commit 540c43c to git@github.com:garbas/migrations-with-transmogrifier.git 
was on 5 Nov 2010 ) refuses to build this excellent presentation
on my Anaconda driven Macos computer.
Still I have no idea how the original presentation was build. 
Maybe it was so easy the author would not have thought of documenting
this formerly easily done step.
So in a first step I just took the original texts and published everything
after issuing a 'make html' to keep it as easy as possible.

Why do I do this ? First of all the original document helped me to get work done - it
was very helpfull to read and a breakthrough for my work to move my customers plone website
to a new version.
The author is moving forwards towards different fields of technologies and just cannot or wants
to respond to updates.
First simple update e.g. would be to remove a typo in basics.rst where 'ExampleTranform'
should be writen as 'ExampleTransform'.

Bringing back the original format "Presentation" again by using the sphinx-Extension 'hieroglyph',
showed this is not just done my typing 'make slides'. 

An important goal of this document is to make usefull information about transmogrifier available.

Please try it by yourself ! Maybe you can help ?
Also if you are working with transmogrifier and want to add to this document, please do so !

Final remark: sorry this looks so ugly for now ... Will hopefully change soon ! If you can please help.
